these are instructions for using git

write this inside the folder you want to turn in to a git repository
git init 


git status

gives you the status of the git repository(folder) you are in, so all the files that need to be added
you can add files by using 



git add <filenamehere>
don't write the <> around the filename those are to show that you type stuff there
you only need to add a file once and then it is in the 'bank'

git commit -am '<your message to describe the current status of your project>'

git status
checks the status of the repository



git clone <https.blablablah>
takes the httpslink from github and allows you to coppy it to your computer

git push
pushes your changes to the online repository

git pull
takes the changes from online and tries to combine it with what you have now

git branch
displays all the branches of your current git directory(I will explain branches later, right now I don't think we have any yet so don't worry about it)

git checkout <nameofbranch>
changes which branch you are working on
